Constraints applied on the following algorithms are :
  a. No. of processes should be positive
  b. Higher priority processes should run for a fixed amount of time.
  c. if batch processes will be running and at the same time if system process comes then the batch process should be preempted.

Boundary condition of the given problem is :
  a. if Priority of a process is between 1-5 then the process will be of higher priority and it will perform round robin scheduling.
  b. if Priority of a process is between 6-10 then the process will be of medium priority and it will perform priority scheduling.
  c. if Priority of a process is between 11-15 then the process will be of lower priority and it will perform first come first serve scheduling.
